Unit Test
-------------
The test framework of choice for this mock server is Mocha:
http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/
 1. along with Supertest for HTTP assertions https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest
 2. and Should.js for BDD style tests https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js
Mocha is a great choice because it makes async test natural and fluent.
